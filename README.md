# Flatfish Disease Detection
This repository contains the code and datasets for the paper "Flatfish Disease Detection Based on Part Segmentation Approach and Disease Image Generation". Our work focuses on the detection of diseases in flatfish through image generation and harmonization using GANs, and disease detection using Part segmentation.

### Dataset Link
The dataset will be available after the paper is accepted. Comming soon.
